# Specification: Core Portfolio Structure

## Overview
This track focuses on establishing the foundational architecture and layout of the portfolio website. The goal is to create a responsive, theme-aware skeleton that serves as a container for all future content.

- **Section Placeholders:** Functional but empty sections for:
    - About
    - Skills
    - Experience
    - Education
    - Projects
    - Contact
- **Navigation:** A functional header with navigation links that scroll to the respective section placeholders.
- **Standard Header/Footer:** Persistent components across the single-page application.

## Success Criteria
- The application loads without errors.
- Light/Dark mode toggle works and persists (optionally).
- Clicking navigation links scrolls correctly to placeholders.
- The layout is visually consistent with "Modern Corporate" guidelines on mobile and desktop.
- 80% test coverage for all new components and logic.
